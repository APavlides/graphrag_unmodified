Report Date: August 10, 2023
Case Number: 12345
Case Worker: Emily Rogers, LCSW
Child's Name: John Doe
DOB: January 10, 2010
Age: 13
Address: [Redacted for privacy]
Primary Guardian: Jane Doe (Mother)

Reason for Referral:
John Doe was referred to social services by his school counselor at Lincoln Middle School following concerns about his increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression, social withdrawal, and a significant decline in academic performance. Additionally, there have been reports of John experiencing frequent panic attacks and expressing feelings of hopelessness. The referral was made to ensure that John receives adequate support and to assess any potential risks within his home environment.

Background Information:
Family Structure: John lives with his mother, Jane Doe, and his younger sister, Emily Doe, age 8. His parents divorced two years ago, and John primarily resides with his mother. His father, Michael Doe, has visitation rights and sees John and his sister on alternate weekends.

Developmental History: John has met all major developmental milestones. There are no significant delays or disabilities reported. He has been described as a bright student who was previously well-adjusted before the onset of his current mental health concerns.

Trauma History: John witnessed domestic violence between his parents prior to their divorce. These incidents have reportedly had a lasting impact on him, contributing to his current emotional and psychological state.

Educational History: John attends Lincoln Middle School, where he has recently shown a noticeable decline in academic performance. He was previously a good student, but his grades have dropped to below average. Teachers have observed that John has become more isolated, withdrawn, and disengaged in class.

Home Environment and Parenting:
Living Conditions: John's home environment appears to be stable. The household is clean and organized, and there are no signs of neglect. Basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter are adequately provided.

Parenting Practices: Jane Doe is actively involved in John's life and is concerned about his well-being. She has sought help for John by bringing him to therapy and discussing his situation with his teachers. She appears to be attentive and responsive to his needs. However, there may be emotional strain on Jane, as she is managing the household as a single parent while working full-time.

Parental Conflict: There is a history of domestic violence between Jane and Michael Doe, which John witnessed. While there is no current evidence of violence, past exposure has likely contributed to John's anxiety and sense of insecurity.

Support Systems: John has some family support through his relationship with his mother and sister. However, his relationship with his father is reportedly strained and infrequent. Jane Doe has expressed interest in continuing therapy for John and is open to exploring additional support options, such as family therapy or parenting support programs.

Child's Perspective:
During a one-on-one interview, John appeared quiet and reserved but was able to communicate his feelings when prompted. He expressed feeling overwhelmed by his emotions, anxious about his academic performance, and disconnected from his peers. John mentioned feeling "different" since his parents' divorce and witnessing the violence. He expressed a desire to "feel normal again," indicating a wish to improve his mental health and social interactions.

John did not report any current thoughts of self-harm or harm to others. However, he did mention having fleeting thoughts of running away, which suggests a need for ongoing monitoring and support.

Assessment of Risk:
Physical Risk: No immediate physical risk to John or his younger sister is apparent. The home environment is safe, and there are no current signs of physical abuse or neglect.

Emotional Risk: John is at moderate emotional risk due to his symptoms of anxiety and depression, which have been exacerbated by past traumas (domestic violence and parental divorce). His sense of hopelessness and social withdrawal are concerning and require intervention.

Social Risk: Johnâ€™s isolation from peers and decline in school performance put him at risk of further social alienation. Without intervention, his social development and academic success may be compromised.

Recommendations:
Continuation of Individual Therapy: John should continue with weekly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions focusing on anxiety and depression. Therapy should also address coping strategies for panic attacks and managing academic stress.

Family Therapy: Family therapy is recommended to improve communication and address any unresolved issues stemming from the divorce and past domestic violence. This will help to provide a more supportive home environment for John.

School-Based Support: Coordination with Lincoln Middle School to implement academic accommodations, such as extra time for assignments and a quiet space for John to use if he feels overwhelmed. School counseling support should also be considered.

Parental Support: Offer parenting support services to Jane Doe to help her manage stress and provide the best possible support to John and his sister. This may include parenting classes or support groups for single parents.

Regular Monitoring: Social services will conduct monthly check-ins with John, Jane, and the school to monitor John's progress and ensure that he is receiving the necessary support.

Peer Support Group: Encouraging John to participate in a peer support group for adolescents dealing with anxiety and depression. This could provide a safe space for him to share his experiences and connect with others who understand his challenges.

Conclusion:
John Doe is experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, likely exacerbated by past traumas and recent life changes. His home environment, while stable, requires ongoing support to address emotional and psychological needs. Continued therapy, family support, and school-based accommodations are recommended to help John achieve emotional stability, improve his academic performance, and reconnect with his peers.
