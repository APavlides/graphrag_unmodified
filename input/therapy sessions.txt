Session 1
Therapist: Hi John, it’s nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?

John: I’m not really sure. I just feel… bad, I guess.

Therapist: I understand. I’m glad you’re here. Can you tell me a little about why you think you’re feeling this way?

John: My mom said I should come. She’s worried about me. I’ve been feeling really anxious and sad lately. Sometimes I just feel like I can’t breathe, and other times, I don’t feel anything at all.

Therapist: I see. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot. Have you noticed when these feelings started?

John: Maybe around six months ago. I’ve had trouble sleeping, and I’ve been feeling like I don’t want to go to school or see my friends. I just want to be alone.

Therapist: That must be really hard. Have you had any panic attacks recently?

John: Yeah, a few times. It feels like my heart is racing, and I can’t catch my breath. It’s really scary.

Therapist: Panic attacks can be very frightening. You’re not alone in feeling that way. Have you ever talked to someone about this before?

John: Not really. We did some family therapy after my parents got divorced, but that was different. I’ve never really talked about how I feel like this before.

Therapist: It’s okay, John. We’re here to help you work through this. How old are you?

John: I’m 13.

Therapist: Thanks for sharing that. Can you tell me a bit about your home life? Who do you live with?

John: I live with my mom and my little sister. My dad moved out when they got divorced two years ago. He still visits sometimes, but it’s not the same.

Therapist: I understand that must have been a big change for you. Moving around a lot and the divorce can be really stressful. Did anything else happen around that time that you think might be important?

John: I saw my parents fight a lot before they got divorced. It was pretty bad. I think that’s when I started feeling anxious, but I didn’t really know what it was back then.

Therapist: That’s understandable. Experiencing conflict like that can have a big impact. It’s good that you’re recognizing these feelings now. Have you ever been on any medication for anxiety or depression?

John: No, I’ve never taken any medication. My mom thought maybe therapy would help before we try anything like that.

Therapist: Therapy can definitely be a good place to start. We can work on strategies to help manage your anxiety and depression. What do you hope to achieve by coming here?

John: I just want to feel normal again. I want to be able to go to school and not feel scared all the time. I want to catch up with my schoolwork and hang out with my friends again.

Therapist: Those are really good goals, John. We’ll work together to help you get there. You’re already taking a big step by being here.

Session 2
Therapist: Hi John, how have you been since our last session?

John: I’ve been okay, I guess. It’s still hard. I had another panic attack at school. I was in class, and suddenly I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I had to leave the room.

Therapist: I’m sorry to hear that. Panic attacks can be really tough to handle, especially in a public place like school. How did you cope with it?

John: I went to the nurse’s office, and they called my mom. She picked me up early. I just felt so embarrassed. I don’t want people to think I’m weird.

Therapist: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Panic attacks are a natural response to stress, and there’s nothing weird about needing some time to feel okay. Have you been able to talk to your teachers about what’s going on?

John: Not really. My mom said she would talk to them, but I don’t know what she said. I just want to catch up with my schoolwork and not fall behind.

Therapist: It’s great that you’re thinking about school and wanting to catch up. Maybe we can work together to come up with a plan to help manage your schoolwork and your anxiety. Have you had any changes in your grades lately?

John: Yeah, my grades have dropped a lot. I used to be a good student, but now I just can’t focus. It’s like my mind is always somewhere else.

Therapist: That makes sense, given everything you’ve been dealing with. It might help to have some support from the school, like extra time on assignments or someone to talk to when you’re feeling anxious. Would you be open to that?

John: I don’t know. I don’t want to stand out or be treated differently.

Therapist: That’s a valid concern. We can find a way to make it as comfortable for you as possible. The goal is to help you feel better and succeed in school without feeling overwhelmed. Have you talked to your friends about how you’ve been feeling?

John: Not really. I’ve been avoiding them. I just don’t know how to explain it.

Therapist: It can be hard to open up, but sometimes friends can be a good support system. We can practice how to talk to them if you want. For now, let’s focus on some techniques to help you during those panic moments.

Session 3
Therapist: Hi John, how are things going this week?

John: A little better, maybe. I’ve been trying some of the breathing exercises you showed me. They help a bit, but I still feel anxious a lot.

Therapist: That’s good progress, John. It’s normal for it to take time. How has school been? Any more panic attacks?

John: I’ve had a couple of times when I felt like I might have one, but I did the breathing, and it didn’t get as bad. I still feel really nervous a lot, though.

Therapist: It sounds like you’re starting to get a handle on your anxiety. That’s a big step. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious sometimes. The goal is to manage it so it doesn’t take over your life. Have you been able to do anything you enjoy, like hobbies or seeing friends?

John: Not really. I’ve just been staying at home mostly. I used to like playing video games with my friends, but I don’t feel like it anymore.

Therapist: Losing interest in things you used to enjoy is common with depression. It’s good to try to reintroduce some of those activities gradually. What about your family? How are things at home?

John: It’s okay. My mom’s been worried about me. She keeps asking if I’m okay, and I feel bad because I don’t want her to worry. My sister’s too young to really understand.

Therapist: Your mom cares about you a lot, and it’s normal for her to be concerned. Maybe you could find a way to talk to her about how you’re feeling without feeling like you’re making her worry more. Have you had any contact with your dad lately?

John: He calls sometimes, but I don’t really feel like talking to him. It’s awkward. I feel like he doesn’t really get what’s going on with me.

Therapist: That makes sense. Parental relationships can be complex, especially after a divorce. Maybe we can explore ways to improve communication with your dad if that’s something you’re interested in.

John: Maybe. I’m not sure.

Therapist: That’s okay. We’ll take it one step at a time. Right now, let’s focus on helping you feel more comfortable at school and finding small things that make you feel good.

Session 4
Therapist: Hi John, how have things been this week?

John: I’m still feeling pretty down. I’ve been trying to keep up with schoolwork, but it’s hard. I feel like I’m never going to catch up.

Therapist: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Have you had a chance to talk to your teachers about any accommodations?

John: My mom talked to them, I think. I don’t know what they said. I just feel like everyone’s watching me, waiting for me to mess up.

Therapist: It’s normal to feel self-conscious, especially when you’re dealing with anxiety and depression. Remember, your teachers want to help you succeed, not make you feel bad. Maybe we can come up with a way for you to communicate directly with them, so you feel more in control.

John: I guess that could work. I just want to get back to normal.

Therapist: You’re making progress, John, even if it doesn’t always feel like it. Have you been able to do any activities you used to enjoy, even for a little while?

John: I played video games with my friends online the other day. It was okay. It was nice to talk to them again, even if I didn’t feel like myself.

Therapist: That’s a great start! It
